    * Courage
    
* **Journal Entry**

  During the first meeting, each team member decided on what XP value they want to advocate and I chose Courage.
  I conveyed the meaning of Courage and how to implement it. We discussed about what Courage as a value represents.
  We decided to code and design for today only so this will increase our effort to avoid getting trapped in design.
  We also talked about having courage to show the problems we face during the Code implementation. And, this will enable the team to feel comfortable refactoring the code.
  
  We also decided to ask our professor for help if needed in any phase of our project. We will be designing and implementing only what is needed for today. We would be making changes that improve the function or structure of code. We decided on throwing the waste away and fixing the design when it is shown to be inadequate.

  I channeled the idea of simplifying code at every turn which will result in reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. The team decided to take the credit only for completing work.

* **XP Value**   
  
    * Feedback
    
* **Journal Entry**

   During first week of project our team worked on deciding strategy to implement our game Space protector on greenfoot . I have selected XP core value : Feedback to work on throughout the project and explained it to other team members. XP value Feedback is a way for determining current state of the application. We will follow XP value Feedback throughout the project. XP value feedback helps to reduce project risk by implementing development in iterative manner. We know the value of frequent feedback and how it helps to make product successful.
  
  So, we have decided to collect feedback from all the teammates throughout the project once in a week because we understand that frequent feedback are very useful to make efficient system.Taking frequent feedback will help to prevent incorrect development in it's early stage.We can collect feedback from generating tests and by communicating with users.This is how feedback is closely related to XP value communication.By implementing feedback,the correct way to approach development is talking about the project first and then adapting our process to it and it is not the way around.To summarize we are going to take every iteration seriously and at the end of which are going to have working software.
