    * Courage
    
* **Journal Entry**

  During the first meeting, each team member decided on what XP value they want to advocate and I chose Courage.
  I conveyed the meaning of Courage and how to implement it. We discussed about what Courage as a value represents.
  We decided to code and design for today only so this will increase our effort to avoid getting trapped in design.
  We also talked about having courage to show the problems we face during the Code implementation. And, this will enable the team to feel comfortable refactoring the code.
  
  We also decided to ask our professor for help if needed in any phase of our project. We will be designing and implementing only what is needed for today. We would be making changes that improve the function or structure of code. We decided on throwing the waste away and fixing the design when it is shown to be inadequate.

  I channeled the idea of simplifying code at every turn which will result in reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. The team decided to take the credit only for completing work.
