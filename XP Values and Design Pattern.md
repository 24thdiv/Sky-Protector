  During the first meeting, each team member decided on what XP value they want to advocate and I chose Courage.
  I conveyed the meaning of Courage and how to implement it. We discussed about what Courage as a value represents.
  We decided to code and design for today only so this will increase our effort to avoid getting trapped in design.
  We also talked about having courage to show the problems we face during the Code implementation. And, this will enable the team to feel comfortable refactoring the code.
  
  We also decided to ask our professor for help if needed in any phase of our project. We will be designing and implementing only what is needed for today. We would be making changes that improve the function or structure of code. We decided on throwing the waste away and fixing the design when it is shown to be inadequate.

  I channeled the idea of simplifying code at every turn which will result in reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily. The team decided to take the credit only for completing work.

    * Feedback

   During first week of project our team worked on deciding strategy to implement our game Space protector on greenfoot . I have selected XP core value : Feedback to work on throughout the project and explained it to other team members. XP value Feedback is a way for determining current state of the application. We will follow XP value Feedback throughout the project. XP value feedback helps to reduce project risk by implementing development in iterative manner. We know the value of frequent feedback and how it helps to make product successful.
  
  So, we have decided to collect feedback from all the teammates throughout the project once in a week because we understand that frequent feedback are very useful to make efficient system.Taking frequent feedback will help to prevent incorrect development in it's early stage.We can collect feedback from generating tests and by communicating with users.This is how feedback is closely related to XP value communication.By implementing feedback,the correct way to approach development is talking about the project first and then adapting our process to it and it is not the way around.To summarize we are going to take every iteration seriously and at the end of which are going to have working software.

   I am advocating Simplicity Core Value of eXtreme Programming Value. During the First Week, we discussed on how to implement "Sky Protector" game on Greenfoot Tool. We started to make basic project requirement gathering and diagrams related to our project. We discussed on making the flow of "Sky Protector" game as simple as possible.

   We also did discuss the issue of implementing the code such that the complexity is minimum and the overhead gets reduced. We also decided to take simple and small steps in order to make any functionality work. The team will be making constant efforts in using polymorphism and inheritance helping us find things when needed.

   For maximizing the efficiency, everyone has given their ideas so that the team can apply during the development. There would be no Duplicity in Methods, Classes or Modules. We will be implementing the code such that the Classes should organize ideas in a readily understandable way and naming should be appropriate and self-explanatory so no one has to explain method, member or class names with additional documentation.

    * Limit Work In Progress   

* **Journal Entry**

  I have selected the Kanban principle of “Limiting Work in Progress” as my value. Limiting the work in progress is one of the core principles of Kanban. It is widely accepted that the human brain cannot do multitasking like a computer. So by limiting the work in progress, we are going to reduce task switching and avoid distraction by successfully reducing multitasking. This will help us to achieve a proper flow which as a result will help us to calculate exactly the amount of work that can be done at a given time. This also helps to REDUCE WASTE due to wrong assumptions and rework by using the virtue of feedback.

  A professional Kanban board should easily allow us to measure the work in progress for each activity by modifying the board template. We may also set the maximum limit for any task in progress. In our project we are using the Waffle.io board which is linked to Github.

  Practically, a Kanban team should only concern itself with the work  "In Progress". Once a task that is in progress is done, it will be moved to the Done section and a new task from the product backlog queue is pulled into the In Progress column and work is started on it. This essentially harnesses a culture of "Done". This is important because "Cycle Time" is an important metric for Agile teams. Limiting the Work in Progress leads to smaller cycle time and increased efficiency. We all know that that the only proof of a successful software development team is working software. To summarize, what we wish to create is a "sustainable engineering culture". By limiting the "Work in Progress", we do not want to rush the developers into doing coding in order to avoid conditions of work overload in particular conditions. They are meant to support solid agile engineering practices that protect the quality of the product and health of the code base. This is how my value of Limiting Work in Progress is going to assist my team in good software engineering.
