This week the team adapted to changes on several things such as fixing a particular design pattern. After implementing the whole game last week, we needed to implement the design pattern on the same game. For this, courage is needed to remove the simple code and code of design pattern needs to be integrated. So, First I conveyed to the team about identifying design patterns in implemented game.

After all the design patterns were identified, all the team members were scared about the complications of implementing those patterns. I advised them to map the design pattern classes and then make a skeleton of every design pattern to our game. Once, the team mapped all the required classes, I suggested them to have confidence and courage to implement the remaining design patterns.

When a team member was implementing Command Pattern, he had an idea which would remove most of the complexity of the game. But, the team was resisting the change and deletion of current code. I encouraged them to put the idea into production. I told them that it is ingenuity of people, not the process that causes the project to succeed.

I am advocating Extreme programming value feedback for our team project. This is our third week of project development. During this three weeks period we almost completed creation of game using greenfoot. After that each individual finalized and started implementing their design patterns. Feedback is very important to stay on the right path during project development process. After completing coding in week 2 it was my responsibility to ensure that feedback from all team members regarding design patterns are collected and evaluated thoroughly, which helped us very much in finalizing our design patterns.

Using feedback we unanimously finalized to go ahead with Strategy,Factory,Observer,State and Command design patterns. During third week I added code to add sound to our game Sky-Protector and took feedback from teammates to know their views regarding sound feel of game and made changes according to that. We take each and every feedback seriously and implement those feedback in our project to improve quality of project. Now we are looking forward to use feedback in the final week to eliminate bugs.

Last week was a great experience for each team member. Team was fully decided on all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements. The team communicated about completing the Skeleton of each team member's design patterns and if some problem occurs, I regulated short stand-up meetings at same collaborative work-space. And in those meetings, I told them if some problem occurs during the implementation of Skeleton, the individual with the problem should communicate with all the others to resolve the issues.

There was a communication gap observed in area of common code that delayed the implementation of their respected module. I noticed which team member was less communicative and I made that person's communication possible with the other team members. The other pro about communication was that all team members appreciated the work done by the others that hiked the team spirit, efficiency and confidence of the team.

I also made the coding easier by advocating the concept of Pair Programming when a team member's implementation of design pattern overlaps with the others. This resulted positively by displaying the status of work done by each team member to the team. Many of the problems were resolved because of this.
