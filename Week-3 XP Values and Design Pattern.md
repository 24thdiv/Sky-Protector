* **Journal Entry**

This week the team adapted to changes on several things such as fixing a particular design pattern. After implementing the whole game last week, we needed to implement the design pattern on the same game. For this, courage is needed to remove the simple code and code of design pattern needs to be integrated. So, First I conveyed to the team about identifying design patterns in implemented game.

After all the design patterns were identified, all the team members were scared about the complications of implementing those patterns. I advised them to map the design pattern classes and then make a skeleton of every design pattern to our game. Once, the team mapped all the required classes, I suggested them to have confidence and courage to implement the remaining design patterns.

When a team member was implementing Command Pattern, he had an idea which would remove most of the complexity of the game. But, the team was resisting the change and deletion of current code. I encouraged them to put the idea into production. I told them that it is ingenuity of people, not the process that causes the project to succeed.
