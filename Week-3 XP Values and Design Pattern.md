   This week the team adapted to changes on several things such as fixing a particular design pattern. After implementing the whole game last week, we needed to implement the design pattern on the same game. For this, courage is needed to remove the simple code and code of design pattern needs to be integrated. So, First I conveyed to the team about identifying design patterns in implemented game.

   After all the design patterns were identified, all the team members were scared about the complications of implementing those patterns. I advised them to map the design pattern classes and then make a skeleton of every design pattern to our game. Once, the team mapped all the required classes, I suggested them to have confidence and courage to implement the remaining design patterns.

   When a team member was implementing Command Pattern, he had an idea which would remove most of the complexity of the game. But, the team was resisting the change and deletion of current code. I encouraged them to put the idea into production. I told them that it is ingenuity of people, not the process that causes the project to succeed.

   I am advocating Extreme programming value feedback for our team project. This is our third week of project development. During this three weeks period we almost completed creation of game using greenfoot. After that each individual finalized and started implementing their design patterns. Feedback is very important to stay on the right path during project development process. After completing coding in week 2 it was my responsibility to ensure that feedback from all team members regarding design patterns are collected and evaluated thoroughly, which helped us very much in finalizing our design patterns.

   Using feedback we unanimously finalized to go ahead with Strategy,Factory,Observer,State and Command design patterns. During third week I added code to add sound to our game Sky-Protector and took feedback from teammates to know their views regarding sound feel of game and made changes according to that. We take each and every feedback seriously and implement those feedback in our project to improve quality of project. Now we are looking forward to use feedback in the final week to eliminate bugs.

   During this week, while implementing the design patterns, most of the modules got too complicated to understand. After that, the team feared the exponential cost of changes and complications in the project. At that time, I reminded them that they are listening to their fears. I also conveyed to the team that is is better to do a simple thing today and pay a little more tomorrow if any module needs to be changed. So, we decided to do the simplest thing that would possibly work.

   Simplicity and Communication support each other mutually. So, when the code got convoluted, I and my other team member who was advocating Communication eXtreme Programming value, gathered the team and collaboratively tried to simplify the implementation of making skeleton of all the design pattern.
   
   When the Game Over functionality was being implemented, the pattern structure was getting confusing. So, we resolved this issue by implementing game over functionality in simplest possible way. And. in state design pattern we decided unanimously on refactoring the system to be the simplest possible code with the current feature set.

    * Limiting Work in Progress 

* **Journal Entry**

   My Kanban value is Limiting Work in Progress. We are in the third week of the development. Working software is the only metric for success of a software team. Planning and documentation can never replace real development. So its understood that lots of development is required to get working software. With an inexperienced team like ours, it is clear that the path to working software is not going to be a clear one. 

   Team members were actively involved in development and as a result each team member had more than two and even three activities in Progress at one time in waffle. We had ironed out a clear rule : Not more than one activity per week per person in waffle. But I had a reality check. We are in the pen-ultimate week of the project which is also a relatively short project. So I decided to be not so iron clad with the rules and allow some agility in the project on the condition that no team member would have more than two issue at the end of the week which will have one core development issue and one enhancement. I communicated this idea to me team mates and they took it very positively and started working in direction of limiting work in Progress immediately.

* **Design Pattern**

    * Observer
    
* **XP Value**   
  
    * Communication   

* **Journal Entry**

   Last week was a great experience for each team member. Team was fully decided on all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements. The team communicated about completing the Skeleton of each team member's design patterns and if some problem occurs, I regulated short stand-up meetings at same collaborative work-space. And in those meetings, I told them if some problem occurs during the implementation of Skeleton, the individual with the problem should communicate with all the others to resolve the issues.

   There was a communication gap observed in area of common code that delayed the implementation of their respected module. I noticed which team member was less communicative and I made that person's communication possible with the other team members. The other pro about communication was that all team members appreciated the work done by the others that hiked the team spirit, efficiency and confidence of the team.

   I also made the coding easier by advocating the concept of Pair Programming when a team member's implementation of design pattern overlaps with the others. This resulted positively by displaying the status of work done by each team member to the team. Many of the problems were resolved because of this.

* **Journal Entry**

   In third week, we decided to implement design patterns in our game Sky-Protector on top of the skeleton we had built in the first two weeks. When meetings were scheduled for the next phase of the project, each team member respected everyone's time by being punctual in all the meetings. In each meeting, I make sure every team member's suggestions and ideas are considered fairly before going ahead with the project.

   The next major part of the project was what design patterns to use? And who will implement them? To decide which pattern will be implemented by whom, we weighed in the things like who is good at which part of the Game, who wants to learn and practice a particular pattern. All the team members carefully listened to everyone's views. Then according to everyone's opinion and every team member's approval, we came to the agreement on who will implement which pattern. As it was a unanimous decision everyone implemented their part enthusiastically.

   In this way, I had made sure that everyone understands the value of respect. And now everyone agrees to the fact that respecting all the team members brings higher productivity in the workflow.
