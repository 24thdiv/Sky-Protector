    In the second week of implementing the project, we started to refine the important requirements.The team has given constant efforts in making the flow of game as simple as possible to reduce the operating cost because the simple solutions are cheaper and quicker to implement.
    
    I helped the team to understand that implementing the design pattern is not the only solution to our project, but the Simplicity is also the part of the efficient solution. While implementing the functionality of health bar of rocket ship and enemy ship, the team confronted the complexity of code. We agreed on removing the inefficient and complex code and replacing it with much simpler code. I conveyed to the team about creating simple class architecture because if a single class breaks, the whole system may break.
    
    I emphasized the point of simplicity while implementing any functionality because the simplest solution are always the robust solutions and make our system less prone to breaking. We also had issue raised to make the code as simple as possible to implement with better efficiency and everyone gave their ideas so that we can apply during implementation.

      In past week, while choosing project and deciding its requirements, I encouraged my team members to scale the requirements which were most important. It takes courage to change the requirements with continuous feedback and openness as well as direct communication with all the team members.
      
      When we were generating firing weapons functionality, the code got staggeringly complex. Few of my team members got scared. They feared about the next requirement becoming inconceivable. I inspired them to focus on implementation of current requirement rather than worrying about the next on. For some functionalities in the project, the team thought that the project is destined to fail- resulting in a "Death March Project", but I encouraged them to tell the truth in communication, which ensued in increased enthusiasm.
      
      In team meeting, one of my team members pointed out complexity as well as redundancy in code. So, I advocated to discard the same code. We also came on conclusion to get rid of ineffective solutions even if we have invested too much time on them.
