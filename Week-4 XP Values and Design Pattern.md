   * This is the last week of our project and we have completed most of the project. We have implemented design pattern in our games and now we are moving towards fixing the bug. We are now going to make changes that improve the functions or structure of the code for that we have decided to walk through code and improve functions and methods. We also change the code that we did not write. The team has been adaptive to several changes as per the project requirements. This week we spent most of the time to fix the bug and add or modify functionality.
  
   * Team member also helped each other to complete their work. Every team member was comfortable asking doubts if they were stuck at some problem. Many time team was afraid of bugs that cannot be solved. But I gave the courage to walk-through each bug and solve that bug with other team member. I actually used pair programming concept to solve bugs and we have solved many bugs using this approach. Every team member report about his work completed in week and each member is truthful about his work.

   * After implementing the each team members design pattern, it was time to simplify the the whole game. While doing the bug fixes, I conveyed the idea of the first test which our project should pass the test of simplicity. I told them that practice of refactoring results in clean and clear code because of clear and clean will result in easily understandable code so there will not be any document required explaining the code of our game. I told them to simplify the only portion of our pattern which is needed tomorrow instead of simplifying the code which is needed tomorrow. This will increase the value of our work being done today.

  
   * I also provided the concept that simplifying the code which will increase the efficiency of our game. Simplicity can also be applied easily with the help of communication. For this instance, we made our code very simple  while fixing the bugs with the help of other team members by communicating during the time of the daily meeting. Thus refactoring and simplifying made our implementation of design pattern very easy to understand and to modify if need arise to do so in future.

    * Limiting Work in Progress   

* **Journal Entry**

   We are into the last week of the project. It is safe to say that my value, that is Limiting Work in Progress is easing off. It is understood that work had significantly decreased as the major portion of the coding has been done. We are now in the enhancement stage of the project. Here we want to iron out the bugs and add a few finishing touches to the games. Even at this stage there are one or two components that have yet to be coded. We wanted to start coding on them but we also wanted to iron out the bugs to make the game look good. We also had some pending work. So we decided to first deal with the bugs and pending work. This is because the bugs will just keep on piling up after the remaining work is done. Also this would give our game some sort of the finished look with only a few components to add after which it would be ready to play and in a presentable state. Needless to say that at this stage the importance of the values like Feedback has increased but that does not mean that Limiting work in progress can be totally overlooked. To summarize these four weeks, my value of limiting work in progress has greatly helped to keep this project nimble and ever evolving.
