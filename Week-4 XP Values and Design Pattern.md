   We are into the last week of the project. It is safe to say that my value, that is Limiting Work in Progress is easing off. It is understood that work had significantly decreased as the major portion of the coding has been done. We are now in the enhancement stage of the project. Here we want to iron out the bugs and add a few finishing touches to the games. Even at this stage there are one or two components that have yet to be coded. We wanted to start coding on them but we also wanted to iron out the bugs to make the game look good. We also had some pending work. So we decided to first deal with the bugs and pending work. This is because the bugs will just keep on piling up after the remaining work is done. Also this would give our game some sort of the finished look with only a few components to add after which it would be ready to play and in a presentable state. Needless to say that at this stage the importance of the values like Feedback has increased but that does not mean that Limiting work in progress can be totally overlooked. To summarize these four weeks, my value of limiting work in progress has greatly helped to keep this project nimble and ever evolving.
