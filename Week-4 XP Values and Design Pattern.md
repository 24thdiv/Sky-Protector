* **Journal Entry**

   * This is the last week of our project and we have completed most of the project. We have implemented design pattern in our games and now we are moving towards fixing the bug. We are now going to make changes that improve the functions or structure of the code for that we have decided to walk through code and improve functions and methods. We also change the code that we did not write. The team has been adaptive to several changes as per the project requirements. This week we spent most of the time to fix the bug and add or modify functionality.
  
   * Team member also helped each other to complete their work. Every team member was comfortable asking doubts if they were stuck at some problem. Many time team was afraid of bugs that cannot be solved. But I gave the courage to walk-through each bug and solve that bug with other team member. I actually used pair programming concept to solve bugs and we have solved many bugs using this approach. Every team member report about his work completed in week and each member is truthful about his work.

    * Feedback   

* **Journal Entry**

   * I have been advocating Extreme programming value feedback for last three weeks for our team project . This was our fourth and final week of project development . During the fourth week of project development we completed remaining coding portion of our game Sky-Protector . After that each team-member completed implementation of their individual design patterns in different sections of project . Feedback has helped us very much throughout the project development process . There were many bugs in the code which needed to be fixed . So we took feedback to prioritize bug fixing and assigned tasks for the same . We also discussed about possibility of adding any new features to our project .
  
   * To summarize these four weeks the value of feedback has brought a great changes in me . I have learnt to listen to everyone and not to cut anyone while speaking . Even the team has learnt to listen to everyone and take others opinion seriously . I ca safely assume that i have been successful in monitoring and moderating the team while the value of feedback was successfully implemented.

    * Simplicity  

* **Journal Entry**

   * After implementing the each team members design pattern, it was time to simplify the the whole game. While doing the bug fixes, I conveyed the idea of the first test which our project should pass the test of simplicity. I told them that practice of refactoring results in clean and clear code because of clear and clean will result in easily understandable code so there will not be any document required explaining the code of our game. I told them to simplify the only portion of our pattern which is needed tomorrow instead of simplifying the code which is needed tomorrow. This will increase the value of our work being done today.

  
   * I also provided the concept that simplifying the code which will increase the efficiency of our game. Simplicity can also be applied easily with the help of communication. For this instance, we made our code very simple  while fixing the bugs with the help of other team members by communicating during the time of the daily meeting. Thus refactoring and simplifying made our implementation of design pattern very easy to understand and to modify if need arise to do so in future.

* **Design Pattern**

    * Limiting Work in Progress   

* **Journal Entry**

   We are into the last week of the project. It is safe to say that my value, that is Limiting Work in Progress is easing off. It is understood that work had significantly decreased as the major portion of the coding has been done. We are now in the enhancement stage of the project. Here we want to iron out the bugs and add a few finishing touches to the games. Even at this stage there are one or two components that have yet to be coded. We wanted to start coding on them but we also wanted to iron out the bugs to make the game look good. We also had some pending work. So we decided to first deal with the bugs and pending work. This is because the bugs will just keep on piling up after the remaining work is done. Also this would give our game some sort of the finished look with only a few components to add after which it would be ready to play and in a presentable state. Needless to say that at this stage the importance of the values like Feedback has increased but that does not mean that Limiting work in progress can be totally overlooked. To summarize these four weeks, my value of limiting work in progress has greatly helped to keep this project nimble and ever evolving.

    * Communication   

* **Journal Entry**

   * Communication gap was resolved in last week due to the efforts of building the huge communication inconsistency. Everybody was able to understand that communication was key to the rapid development of the project. One team member who was implementing strategy design pattern had good understanding of command pattern. So they both decided to work together which was very fruitful for both of them. Such communication between team's individuals was the secret to rhythmic flow of our project development. This method of person to person communication instead of writing documents made development very flawless.
   * Discussions team is having in final week involves concise and clear narration thoughts. Bugs created during integration of each of the team members' modules were getting fixed. Although, bugs in numbers were very high, using the efficient communication they were getting fixed very quickly. Refactoring of code was getting done efficiently because of daily meeting happening at the same time and at the exact location. Finally, team could see the game being finalized with each bug fixes by members.
